# TimePlayed WoW Addon

## Description
An addon for [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/) that shows you how long you've been playing since logging in. It resets on logout.

## Commands
/timeplayed, /tp - Show the default bar with long names

/tpshort, /tps - Show the bar with short names

## Usage
You can either download the zip archive from releases, or manually download the TimePlayed.lua and TimePlayed.toc and put them in a folder located in your WoW addons folder.

If you're using CurseForge, I've posted it on there as well, [here's the link](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/time-played).
